## Overview

This Chrome extension serves as a comprehensive example of implementing secure authentication in browser extensions using Descope's device flow. It demonstrates modern web development practices, secure token handling, and seamless user experience design within the constraints of Chrome's extension security model.

The extension uses the OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow, which is ideal for devices with limited input capabilities or when user interaction needs to be minimal.

## Features

- üîê **Secure Device Flow Authentication** - OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant
- üé® **Modern UI/UX** - Clean, responsive popup interface
- üîß **Manifest V3 Compliant** - Uses latest Chrome extension standards
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Best Practices** - Secure token storage and handling
- üîÑ **Real-time Updates** - Live authentication status updates
- üì± **Cross-platform** - Works on all platforms supporting Chrome
- üéØ **Production Ready** - Built with rollup for optimized bundles
- üîå **Easy Integration** - Simple setup with any Descope project

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v16 or later recommended)
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** (comes with Node.js)

   ```

## Usage

### Loading the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist/` directory from this project
4. The Descope extension icon will appear in your Chrome extensions toolbar

### Authenticating with the Extension

1. **Click the extension icon** to open the popup interface
2. **Enter your Descope configuration:**
   - **Issuer Domain**: Your Descope project domain (e.g., `api.descope.org`)
   - **Client ID**: Your Descope project ID
3. **Click Login** to initiate the device flow authentication

   - Visit the provided verification URL
   - Enter the displayed user code
   - Complete the authentication process
5. **Return to the extension** - Your user information will be displayed upon successful authentication

## Development Workflow

### Development Mode

For active development with live reloading:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This command:
- Uses Rollup to bundle JavaScript and CSS
- Watches for file changes
- Outputs built files to the `dist/` directory
- Enables hot reloading during development

### Building for Production

For production builds:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Extension Development Tips

- **Reload the extension** in `chrome://extensions/` after making changes
- **Check the Console** in Chrome DevTools for debugging
- **Use Developer Tools** on the popup by right-clicking and selecting "Inspect"

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Build the extension for production |
| `npm run watch` | Build and watch for changes during development |
| `npm test` | Run tests (currently not implemented) |

## Configuration

### Descope Setup

1. **Create a Descope Project:**
   - Sign up at [Descope Console](https://app.descope.com/sign-up)
   - Create a new project
   - Note your Project ID (Client ID)

2. **Configure OAuth Settings:**
   - In your Descope console, navigate to Settings ‚Üí OAuth
   - Ensure device flow is enabled for your project
   - Configure redirect URIs if needed

3. **Update Extension Configuration:**
   - Use your Project ID as the Client ID in the extension
   - Use your project's issuer domain (typically `api.descope.org`)

### Environment Variables

The extension uses runtime configuration through the popup interface. For development, you can modify default values in `src/index.js`:

```javascript
const defaultIssuerDomain = "api.descope.org";
const defaultClientId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID";
```
